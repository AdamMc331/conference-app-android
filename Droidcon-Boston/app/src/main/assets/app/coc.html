<p>We want <b>Droidcon Boston</b> to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct
    spells out the behavior we support and don’t support at conferences. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and
    volunteers at our conference are required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this
    code throughout the event.</p>

<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
    gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
    national origin, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We invite you to help us make
    <b>Droidcon Boston</b> a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants. So that everyone can focus on the
    conference itself, learning and growing in their own way, and the great networking and community richness that
    happens when we get together in person, we will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form—in
    person or online.</p>

<p>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, intimidation, stalking, harassing
    photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual
    attention. Harassment also includes slights and negative messages, both unintended and intentional, based solely
    on appearance (sometimes called micro-aggressions). Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any
    conference setting.</p>

<p>We expect all participants to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes conference-related
    social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to
    stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of
    Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future <b>Droidcon Boston</b>
    events.</p>

<h3>Need Help?</h3>

<p>Reach out to any conference organizer if you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct itself or the
    behavior of any participants before, during or after the conference. We will treat all violations of the Code of
    Conduct seriously. You can also email us at <b>coc@droidcon-boston.com</b>.</p>
